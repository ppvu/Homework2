# Homework2
my Bet System

Here is a second PM Tech Academy homework.

I implement a betting system with following features:

- The system should provide a way to register a new user. Upon the registration, you should provide the user's role (admin or regular user), username, password.
- All usernames must be unique. Abort the registration if the chosen username is already busy.
- Users should be able to login/logout in/from the system.
- When authorized, a regular user should be able to place a new bet.
- A bet is a simple string which contains description of an event.
- An authorized user should be able to print a list of placed bets.
- An authorized admin user should be able to browse all registered regular users.
- An admin user should be able to ban a regular user.
- When the banned user tries to login, he should be rejected.
